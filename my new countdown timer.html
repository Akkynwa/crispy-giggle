        <p style="padding:7%;font-size: 16px;">Did you oversleep today? Were you in a hurry to get to school ON TIME? We have all went through
            this. We have all been under pressure because of time.<br> It is all around us. But is it what we think it is?
            Time seems to flow forward… But can it run backward? Do events unfold one after another, or do
            past, present and future exist side by side? Is time a fundamental part of the Universe, or could it be that
            time does not really exist?<br>

            
            What time is it? I could tell you it is 7:14 p.m., but your time may vary, depending on where and
            when you are. But for most of us time is a set of numbers we use to gauge our days. We live our lives by
            the clock – waking up, racing to work, going to bed, and on and on. However, it was not always like that.
        
            The concept of time is related with the motion and the change in the objects around us.All objects
            begin, develop and end in time and that holds true not only for us , the human beings, but also for the
            stars and the universe.In the Newtonian physics time is used as a parameter to describe the motion of
            objects.But this does not necessarily mean that time exists in reality.<br>
            We can,t perceive time itself but only the flow of time.Every instant the present turns into past and the
            future - into present.We feel this passage of time because the past is quite different compared with the
            future: we have memories of the past, but we don,t know anything about the future.And we cannot stop the
            present: even when we are talking about the present instant, it,s already gone into past.Since the flow of
            time makes a given moment come on the present stage only for an instant and the past and future exist
            only in our consciousness, one may think that time doesn,t exist in reality but is only a psychological
            phenomenon.<br>
            We shall prove, using the theory of relativity , that time actually doesn,t flow and this is an indication
            for the real existence of time.Let,s regard a model of the space-time suggested by Brian Greene(ref.1).He
            considers the universe as a sliced loaf of bread(Fig.1).Each slice is a time cross section of the universe, i.e.
            it contains all the events that take place in the entire universe at a certain instant according to a given
            observer.If he could look at this picture from above , he could see all the events from the past, the present
            and the future in the different slices, like the Big Bang, the origin of the Sun, the birth of his future</p>
